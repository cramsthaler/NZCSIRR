&lt;ul>
&lt;li>RBNZ - Reserve Bank of New Zealand&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Impact:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A file-sharing application, known as Accellion, had been compromised, potentially exposing personal and commercially sensitive information.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We estimate the final cost of the breach response, including internal resources, will be around $3.5 million. This excludes any process improvement initiatives we are likely to take as a result of the lessons learnt. All costs associated with the breach were covered under our baseline budgets. The main details of the costs include:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>17,500 hours of internal resources redirected to help with the response&lt;/li>
&lt;li>$1,800,000 spent on specialist external resources, these being individuals to supplement our staff on the stream activity or organisations delivering a defined piece of work.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Accellion&amp;rsquo;s failure to warn RBNZ of exploited bug led to hack &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/accellions-failure-to-warn-rbnz-of-exploited-bug-led-to-hack-565323" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>https://www.itnews.com.au/news/accellions-failure-to-warn-rbnz-of-exploited-bug-led-to-hack-565323&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Summary:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The hack took place on Christmas Day 2020, and the RBNZ went public about the data breach on January 11, noting it included commercially and personally sensitive information.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;We have been advised by the third party provider that this wasn&amp;rsquo;t a specific attack on the Reserve Bank, and other users of the file sharing application were also compromised,&amp;rdquo; Orr said.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A certification and accreditation process to understand and ensure that any key risks were identified and managed had not been done on the FTA by RBNZ.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Unauthorised access was obtained to a third-party developed file transfer system, Accellion File Transfer Application (FTA) (“the System”) used by the Bank in late 2020. This access was obtained by exploiting a previously unknown vulnerability in the FTA application.&lt;/li>

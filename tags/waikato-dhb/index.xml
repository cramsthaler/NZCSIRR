&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Waikato District Health Board&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Impact:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Clinical services across all Waikato public hospitals have been seriously affected by a cyber security incident with all phones and computers down.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Clinical services at Waikato, Thames, Tokoroa, Te Kuiti and Taumaranui hospitals are all affected to varying degrees.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>surgeries were postponed, and seriously ill patients had to be transferred to
other hospitals within other DHBs .&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Corporate and patient information was also posted on the internet and then reported in mainstream media.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It took several months for WDHB to restore the systems compromised by the attacker and address the backlog of surgeries and appointments that resulted from the attack. The incident was officially closed out on the 10 h of November 2021 – the majority of systems had been recovered and were operating securely by this date.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>WAIKATO DISTRICT HEALTH BOARD (WDHB) INCIDENT RESPONSE
ANALYSIS &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.tewhatuora.govt.nz/assets/Publications/Proactive-releases/WDHB-Final-Report-2.0-redacted.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Summary:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The Ministry of Health (MOH) said the &amp;ldquo;attempted cyber incident&amp;rdquo; occurred overnight and all the internal systems, except for email, were temporarily shut down.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>On the 18th of May 2021, the WDHB became the victim of a large-scale criminal
ransomware attack.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>WDHB’s initial response was to physically disconnect from the Internet and other health systems all its own services, including corporate IT systems,laptops, printers, phones, medical devices, and any cloud services to protect from any
further potential compromise by the attacker.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This affected healthcare services across the region, including Waikato Hospital, Thames Hospital, Te Kuiti Hospital, Tokoroa Hospital, and Taumarunui Hospital. It also affected other DHBs, primary and community providers who used shared services, including shared clinical services.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cloud services such as MS Teams, email, and the IT service management system remained available, and came to be accessed by clinical staff using ‘new’ machines.&lt;/li>

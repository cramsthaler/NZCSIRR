**Impact:**

**Summary:**
* Insider had worked for NZTA for roughly eight years before she began dating a member of the King Cobras.
* From mid-2021 through to March 2023, she accessed the motor vehicle register and driver licensing register, which is a secure database housed at NZTA and requires employees to sign a code of conduct before they are allowed to use it.
* She would look up drivers or vehicles in the databases and pass the information to her then partner and other members of the gang. She was given meth as payment.
* She came up with a set of rules for herself about when she would access the information as well as a cover story that she was simply making sure a vehicle she wanted to buy had a clean record.

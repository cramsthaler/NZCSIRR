**Impacted Agency:**
* Mercury IT and it's customers, e.g. NZ governament agencies (Ministry of Justice; Te Whatu Ora)

**Impact:**
* Ministry of Justice said that the attack was preventing it from accessing 14,500 files relating to the transportation of deceased people’s bodies, and roughly 4,000 post-mortem examinations dating from March 2020 to November.
* Te Whatu Ora, the country’s health ministry, said its access to data relating to bereavement and cardiac services was impacted. It said roughly 8,500 records about bereavement care services were inaccessible, alongside 5,500 records from the cardiac and inherited disease registry.
“While the above records are currently inaccessible, there is no evidence at this stage that they have been subject to unauthorized access or download,” said the ministry.

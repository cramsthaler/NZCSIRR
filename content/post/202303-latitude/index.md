**Summary:**
* On 16 March 2023, Latitude1 announced that it had experienced a malicious cyber-attack over the prior few days that resulted in a data theft.
* Our investigation identified that the cybercriminals used a compromised credential, obtained via a third-party, to access Latitude's network and steal personal information.
* We immediately alerted relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies, including the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) and the Australian Federal Police (AFP), and engaged external cyber security specialists to work alongside our own teams.
* This crime remains under investigation by the AFP. We also notified the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) and the New Zealand Office of the Privacy Commissioner (OPC) about the incident on 16 March 2023, and we continue to work with them.

* The types of information held in this database and accessed by the attacker include name, date of birth, gender, postal address and/or post code, email address, phone number, and in some cases images or videos that may have been submitted as part of the entry. 
* Importantly, the affected database did not contain passwords, identity documents, financial information, bank accounts or credit card details.
* Hackers have begun contacting victims directly via email, demanding NZD $820 to prevent their data from being leaked.
* Widespread concern among victims and significant reputational damage for MediaWorks.

**Summary:**

* The hackers have contacted individuals affected by the breach, demanding ransom payments in exchange for not leaking their personal information.
* Law enforcement agencies are involved in investigating the attack, and MediaWorks has issued guidance to individuals on how to protect themselves.
* The hackers' demands have escalated concerns over how the data might be used if the ransom is not paid, leading to potential privacy risks for those affected.

* MediaWorks reported the incident to * CERT NZ and the New Zealand Police
* In line with New Zealand Government guidance, MediaWorks has not engaged with the attacker.

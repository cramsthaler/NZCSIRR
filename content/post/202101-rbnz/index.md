**Impacted Agency:**
* RBNZ - Reserve Bank of New Zealand

**Impact:**
* 1
* We estimate the final cost of the breach response, including internal resources, will be around $3.5 million. This excludes any process improvement initiatives we are likely to take as a result of the lessons learnt. All costs associated with the breach were covered under our baseline budgets.
The main details of the costs include:
 * 17,500 hours of internal resources redirected to help with the response
 * $1,800,000 spent on specialist external resources, these being individuals to supplement our staff on the stream activity or organisations delivering a defined piece of work which included:
  * cyber security services to investigate and provide an analysis of the files downloaded or potentially downloaded 
  * an independent review that confirmed the analysis of the cyber security findings
  * legal services to advise on privacy aspects
  * helpdesk support for impacted stakeholders
  * monitoring of the internet for any data obtained by the breach.
 * services related to physical facilities including the set up of a response room to allow co-location of the response team. Additional physical security was also required onsite.

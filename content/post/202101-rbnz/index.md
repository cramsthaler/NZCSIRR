**Impacted Agency:**
* RBNZ - Reserve Bank of New Zealand

**Impact:**
* A file-sharing application, known as Accellion, had been compromised, potentially exposing personal and commercially sensitive information.
* We estimate the final cost of the breach response, including internal resources, will be around $3.5 million. This excludes any process improvement initiatives we are likely to take as a result of the lessons learnt. All costs associated with the breach were covered under our baseline budgets. The main details of the costs include:
  * 17,500 hours of internal resources redirected to help with the response
  * $1,800,000 spent on specialist external resources, these being individuals to supplement our staff on the stream activity or organisations delivering a defined piece of work.

**Summary:**
* The hack took place on Christmas Day 2020, and the RBNZ went public about the data breach on January 11, noting it included commercially and personally sensitive information.
* "We have been advised by the third party provider that this wasn't a specific attack on the Reserve Bank, and other users of the file sharing application were also compromised," Orr said.
* A certification and accreditation process to understand and ensure that any key risks were identified and managed had not been done on the FTA by RBNZ.
* Unauthorised access was obtained to a third-party developed file transfer system, Accellion File Transfer Application (FTA) (“the System”) used by the Bank in late 2020. This access was obtained by exploiting a previously unknown vulnerability in the FTA application.

Welcome to NZCSIRR 

**Objective:**
The intend for this page is to create a repository of published New Zealand specific Cyber Security Incidents. Only incidents with publicly available reference are included here.
Whether you are a new starter in the industry and were not around yet when those incidents happened or you are a seasoned GRC consultant and can't quite re-call what the name of the agency was that got badly owned, you can bookmark this page here and easily have this information at your fingertips.

**Motivation: **
How many times during risk assessments have cyber security non-believers argued with you, that this risk will never eventuate in my business, my industry, in New Zealand? 
Or the consequences you estimated were challenged?  A common approach to justify ratings is with examples of when it happened before, but many of the "good" examples are usually from overseas and larger corporates.
This Repository here will give you links to specific New Zealand incidents as well as New Zealand specific statistics. 

Criteria:

to be added here the incident has to:
* has to be publicaly disclosed and have a citable reference (e.g. news article or media release etc)
* has a to have a connection to New Zealand, e.g. the impacted agancy is in NZ or it has an impact on NZ society etc.

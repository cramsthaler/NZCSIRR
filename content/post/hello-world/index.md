**Objective:**
This page serves as a repository of publicly documented cybersecurity incidents specific to New Zealand. It includes only incidents with publicly available references. 
Whether you're just starting out in the industry and missed these events, or you're a seasoned GRC consultant needing to refresh your memory on past incidents, this page offers a convenient resource for quick access to relevant information.

**Motivation:**
How many times during risk assessments have cybersecurity skeptics claimed, "This risk will never impact my business, my industry, or New Zealand"? Or perhaps theyâ€™ve questioned your impact estimates? While examples are often used to justify risk ratings, many of the most relevant cases are from overseas or large corporations. Unfortunately, much of the detailed incident information is shared privately, in infomration exchanges or in trust groups, limiting its use in public decision-making. This repository offers links to New Zealand-specific incidents and statistics, enabling you to make more informed risk assessments and educate decision-makers within your organization. 

**Criteria:**
to be added here, the incident has to:
* be publicaly disclosed and have a citable reference (e.g. news article or media release etc)
* have a connection to New Zealand, e.g. the impacted agancy is in NZ or it has an impact on NZ society etc.

**Post format:**
Each incident post has categaories and tags assigned for easy searching and grouping. All posts are structured in the same format:
* Name of the impacted agency
* Impact of the incident
* References > links to the publically available resources
* Short summary of the incident

**Feedback & Additions:**
If you would like to see other incidents added here, please send me the link to the publications via DM in [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisramsthaler/)

[{"content":"Objective: This page serves as a repository of publicly documented cybersecurity incidents specific to New Zealand. It includes only incidents with publicly available references. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re just starting out in the industry and missed these events, or you\u0026rsquo;re a seasoned GRC consultant needing to refresh your memory on past incidents, this page offers a convenient resource for quick access to relevant information.\nMotivation: How many times during risk assessments have cybersecurity skeptics claimed, \u0026ldquo;This risk will never impact my business, my industry, or New Zealand\u0026rdquo;? Or perhaps they’ve questioned your impact estimates? While examples are often used to justify risk ratings, many of the most relevant cases are from overseas or large corporations. Unfortunately, much of the detailed incident information is shared privately, in infomration exchanges or in trust groups, limiting its use in public decision-making. This repository offers links to New Zealand-specific incidents and statistics, enabling you to make more informed risk assessments and educate decision-makers within your organization.\nCriteria: to be added here, the incident has to:\nbe publicaly disclosed and have a citable reference (e.g. news article or media release etc) have a connection to New Zealand, e.g. the impacted agancy is in NZ or it has an impact on NZ society etc. Post format: Each incident post has categaories and tags assigned for easy searching and grouping.

This was not actioned by Tū Ora or their IT service provider. b. 5 August 2019 - Tū Ora web server was exploited by this method and the attacker ‘defaced’ their website, ultimately alerting Tū Ora that they had been attacked. c. 6 August 2019 - Ministry of Health was notified by Tū Ora of the successful attack on their website. Tū Ora Compass Health took immediate steps to contain the incident, called in experts to start an investigation, and notified CERT NZ and the NCSC. d. 8 August 2019 - The NCSC initiated a forensic investigation; this is continuing and is expected to take a further two to three weeks. e. 15 August 2019 – Tū Ora issued a press release stating that is website had come under attack but did not disclose the likelihood that unencrypted personally identifiable information was also stored on that same server. f. 15 August 2019 – NCSC provided an update that three further server exploits were found on the server. Based on the information available to date, the server was compromised twice in 2016, and twice in 2019. Additionally, access to Tū Ora’s environment would provide access to data held on over one million people that have lived within the geographic area of Capital and Coast, Wairarapa and Mid Central DHBs and registered with a GP over the last 17 years. Privacy Commissioner John Edwards said his office was notified of the breach in early September then had a full briefing on September 9. \u0026ldquo;At the time I was briefed, it appeared that the vulnerability did not compromise detailed patient information such as consultation notes, however I was advised that there was a risk that enrolment records, including identifying information, diagnostic codes and lab results might have been able to be accessed by a third party. \u0026ldquo;I was advised that it was not possible to say with certainty whether any of that identifiable data had been accessed and/or exfiltrated.\u0026rdquo; ","date":"2019-08-05T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://cramsthaler.github.io/NZCSIRR/p/cyber-security-breach-at-t%C5%AB-ora-compass-health/","title":"Cyber security breach at Tū Ora Compass Health"},{"content":"Impacted Agency:\nNZ Treasury Impact:\nEmbargoed Government Budget data leaked References:\nTreasury News page: https://www.treasury.govt.nz/news-and-events/news/unauthorised-access-budget-information - Local pdf copy Secondary source:https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/new-zealand-govt-finds-sufficient-evidence-it-was-hacked - Local pdf copy Summary:\nAn unknown person exploited a feature in the Treasury\u0026rsquo;s website search tool, but this was not deemed unlawful by the Police, so no further action is planned. The Treasury and National Cyber Security Centre are investigating the incident, revealing that a clone of the Treasury website, intended for Budget 2019, contained indexed content that was accessible via specific search terms. Approximately 2,000 search terms were used to extract small amounts of information from the 2019/20 Estimates documents, using phrases from the 2018 Budget followed by “Summary” of each Vote. The searches were systematic and persistent, involving three IP addresses belonging to the Parliamentary Service, 2degrees, and Vocus. The incident led to unauthorized access to limited content from the 2019/20 Estimates documents, intended to be confidential until Budget Day. Treasury Secretary Gabriel Makhlouf acknowledged the breach and announced a review to enhance security and prevent future incidents, with the State Services Commissioner asked to conduct an inquiry.

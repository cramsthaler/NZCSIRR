&lt;li>RNZ - NZTA employee traded motorists&amp;rsquo; private information to gang members for meth [https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/523154/nzta-employee-traded-motorists-private-information-to-gang-members-for-meth] (&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/523154/nzta-employee-traded-motorists-private-information-to-gang-members-for-meth" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Summary:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Insider had worked for NZTA for roughly eight years before she began dating a member of the King Cobras.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>From mid-2021 through to March 2023, she accessed the motor vehicle register and driver licensing register, which is a secure database housed at NZTA and requires employees to sign a code of conduct before they are allowed to use it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>She would look up drivers or vehicles in the databases and pass the information to her then partner and other members of the gang. She was given meth as payment.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>She came up with a set of rules for herself about when she would access the information as well as a cover story that she was simply making sure a vehicle she wanted to buy had a clean record.&lt;/li>

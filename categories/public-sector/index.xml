&lt;p>&lt;strong>Summary:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A motor vehicle trader with authorised access to the DLR and the MVR had their account compromised. NZTA also notified the New Zealand Police and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The illegally accessed information was gained through MotorWeb, a third-party on-line portal, after the identity of a motor vehicle trader and its staff was used to create a fraudulent account to access information held on the MVR and DLR.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Summary:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Insider had worked for NZTA for roughly eight years before she began dating a member of the King Cobras.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>From mid-2021 through to March 2023, she accessed the motor vehicle register and driver licensing register, which is a secure database housed at NZTA and requires employees to sign a code of conduct before they are allowed to use it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>She would look up drivers or vehicles in the databases and pass the information to her then partner and other members of the gang. She was given meth as payment.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>She came up with a set of rules for herself about when she would access the information as well as a cover story that she was simply making sure a vehicle she wanted to buy had a clean record.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Auckland University of Technology (AUT)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Impact:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Personal information of students, faculty, and staff potentially compromised.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hackers have threatened to release sensitive university data unless a ransom is paid.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>AUT’s network and systems experienced disruption as a result of the cyberattack.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>60GB of Data exfiltrated includes confidential student records, research data, and internal university documents.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Summary:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In September 2023, AUT became the target of a ransomware attack.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hackers claimed they had stolen a significant amount of sensitive data and threatened to release it publicly if a ransom was not paid.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The breach affected AUT’s internal systems, causing service disruptions and forcing the university to assess and secure its network infrastructure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>AUT engaged with cybersecurity experts and law enforcement agencies to investigate the extent of the breach.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The university has been transparent with stakeholders about the attack and has advised affected individuals to take precautionary steps to safeguard their information.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The hackers have given a deadline for ransom payment, raising fears of data being leaked if demands are not met.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Summary:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The spy agencies&amp;rsquo; minister Judith Collins revealed in a statement on 26/03/2024 New Zealand&amp;rsquo;s Parliamentary Service and Parliamentary Counsel Office had been targeted in a China-linked 2021 cyberattack.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Parliamentary Service provides administrative and support services to Parliament and its MPs, while the Parliamentary Counsel Office (PCO) is responsible for drafting and publishing legislation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;The GCSB&amp;rsquo;s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) completed a robust technical assessment following a compromise of the Parliamentary Counsel Office and the Parliamentary Service in 2021, and has attributed this activity to a PRC state-sponsored group known as APT40,&amp;rdquo; Collins said&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Fortunately, in this instance, the NCSC worked with the impacted organisations to contain the activity and remove the actor shortly after they were able to access the network.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Impact:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Clinical services across all Waikato public hospitals have been seriously affected by a cyber security incident with all phones and computers down.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Clinical services at Waikato, Thames, Tokoroa, Te Kuiti and Taumaranui hospitals are all affected to varying degrees.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>surgeries were postponed, and seriously ill patients had to be transferred to
other hospitals within other DHBs .&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Corporate and patient information was also posted on the internet and then reported in mainstream media.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It took several months for WDHB to restore the systems compromised by the attacker and address the backlog of surgeries and appointments that resulted from the attack. The incident was officially closed out on the 10 h of November 2021 – the majority of systems had been recovered and were operating securely by this date.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Summary:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The Ministry of Health (MOH) said the &amp;ldquo;attempted cyber incident&amp;rdquo; occurred overnight and all the internal systems, except for email, were temporarily shut down.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>On the 18th of May 2021, the WDHB became the victim of a large-scale criminal
ransomware attack.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>WDHB’s initial response was to physically disconnect from the Internet and other health systems all its own services, including corporate IT systems,laptops, printers, phones, medical devices, and any cloud services to protect from any
further potential compromise by the attacker.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This affected healthcare services across the region, including Waikato Hospital, Thames Hospital, Te Kuiti Hospital, Tokoroa Hospital, and Taumarunui Hospital. It also affected other DHBs, primary and community providers who used shared services, including shared clinical services.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cloud services such as MS Teams, email, and the IT service management system remained available, and came to be accessed by clinical staff using ‘new’ machines.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>17,500 hours of internal resources redirected to help with the response&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Summary:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The hack took place on Christmas Day 2020, and the RBNZ went public about the data breach on January 11, noting it included commercially and personally sensitive information.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;We have been advised by the third party provider that this wasn&amp;rsquo;t a specific attack on the Reserve Bank, and other users of the file sharing application were also compromised,&amp;rdquo; Orr said.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A certification and accreditation process to understand and ensure that any key risks were identified and managed had not been done on the FTA by RBNZ.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Unauthorised access was obtained to a third-party developed file transfer system, Accellion File Transfer Application (FTA) (“the System”) used by the Bank in late 2020. This access was obtained by exploiting a previously unknown vulnerability in the FTA application.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Summary:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>An unknown person exploited a feature in the Treasury&amp;rsquo;s website search tool, but this was not deemed unlawful by the Police, so no further action is planned.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Treasury and National Cyber Security Centre are investigating the incident, revealing that a clone of the Treasury website, intended for Budget 2019, contained indexed content that was accessible via specific search terms.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Approximately 2,000 search terms were used to extract small amounts of information from the 2019/20 Estimates documents, using phrases from the 2018 Budget followed by “Summary” of each Vote.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The searches were systematic and persistent, involving three IP addresses belonging to the Parliamentary Service, 2degrees, and Vocus.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The incident led to unauthorized access to limited content from the 2019/20 Estimates documents, intended to be confidential until Budget Day.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Treasury Secretary Gabriel Makhlouf acknowledged the breach and announced a review to enhance security and prevent future incidents, with the State Services Commissioner asked to conduct an inquiry.&lt;/li>

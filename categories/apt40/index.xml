&lt;ul>
&lt;li>New Zealand&amp;rsquo;s Parliamentary Service and Parliamentary Counsel Office&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Impact:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Specific Impact was not disclosed&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fortunately, in this instance, the NCSC worked with the impacted organisations to contain the activity and remove the actor shortly after they were able to access the network.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some information was removed from the networks, but the GCSB believed it was of a technical nature and information of a sensitive or strategic nature was not taken&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Summary:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The spy agencies&amp;rsquo; minister Judith Collins revealed in a statement on 26/03/2024 New Zealand&amp;rsquo;s Parliamentary Service and Parliamentary Counsel Office had been targeted in a China-linked 2021 cyberattack.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Parliamentary Service provides administrative and support services to Parliament and its MPs, while the Parliamentary Counsel Office (PCO) is responsible for drafting and publishing legislation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;The GCSB&amp;rsquo;s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) completed a robust technical assessment following a compromise of the Parliamentary Counsel Office and the Parliamentary Service in 2021, and has attributed this activity to a PRC state-sponsored group known as APT40,&amp;rdquo; Collins said&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Fortunately, in this instance, the NCSC worked with the impacted organisations to contain the activity and remove the actor shortly after they were able to access the network.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>

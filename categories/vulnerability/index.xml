&lt;ul>
&lt;li>MediaWorks, a prominent New Zealand-based broadcasting company&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Impact:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>MediaWorks notified around 403,000 individuals that information they supplied as part of a competition entry had been involved in a cyber attack. The affected database included entries for online competitions dating back to 2016.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The types of information held in this database and accessed by the attacker include name, date of birth, gender, postal address and/or post code, email address, phone number, and in some cases images or videos that may have been submitted as part of the entry.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Importantly, the affected database did not contain passwords, identity documents, financial information, bank accounts or credit card details.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hackers have begun contacting victims directly via email, demanding NZD $820 to prevent their data from being leaked.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Widespread concern among victims and significant reputational damage for MediaWorks.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Summary:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In March 2024, MediaWorks experienced a significant data breach, allegedly carried out by cybercriminals who gained access to the company’s systems and exfiltrated personal data of New Zealanders.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The hackers have contacted individuals affected by the breach, demanding ransom payments in exchange for not leaking their personal information.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Law enforcement agencies are involved in investigating the attack, and MediaWorks has issued guidance to individuals on how to protect themselves.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The hackers&amp;rsquo; demands have escalated concerns over how the data might be used if the ransom is not paid, leading to potential privacy risks for those affected.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>MediaWorks notified the Privacy Commissioner&lt;/li>
&lt;li>MediaWorks reported the incident to * CERT NZ and the New Zealand Police&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In line with New Zealand Government guidance, MediaWorks has not engaged with the attacker.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Hackers claimed they had stolen a significant amount of sensitive data and threatened to release it publicly if a ransom was not paid.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The breach affected AUT’s internal systems, causing service disruptions and forcing the university to assess and secure its network infrastructure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>AUT engaged with cybersecurity experts and law enforcement agencies to investigate the extent of the breach.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The university has been transparent with stakeholders about the attack and has advised affected individuals to take precautionary steps to safeguard their information.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The hackers have given a deadline for ransom payment, raising fears of data being leaked if demands are not met.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Summary:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A high-level timeline of the incident is as follows:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>a. 10 July 2019 - Tū Ora was directly contacted by the NCSC notifying them that their web server was exposed to a publicly known vulnerability from 2017. This was not actioned by Tū Ora or their IT service provider.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>b. 5 August 2019 - Tū Ora web server was exploited by this method and the attacker ‘defaced’ their website, ultimately alerting Tū Ora that they had been attacked.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>c. 6 August 2019 - Ministry of Health was notified by Tū Ora of the successful attack on their website. Tū Ora Compass Health took immediate steps to contain the incident, called in experts to start an investigation, and notified CERT NZ and the NCSC.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>d. 8 August 2019 - The NCSC initiated a forensic investigation; this is continuing and is expected to take a further two to three weeks.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>e. 15 August 2019 – Tū Ora issued a press release stating that is website had come under attack but did not disclose the likelihood that unencrypted personally identifiable information was also stored on that same server.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>f. 15 August 2019 – NCSC provided an update that three further server exploits were found on the server. Based on the information available to date, the server was compromised twice in 2016, and twice in 2019.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Additionally, access to Tū Ora’s environment would provide access to data held on over one million people that have lived within the geographic area of Capital and Coast, Wairarapa and Mid Central DHBs and registered with a GP over the last 17 years.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Privacy Commissioner John Edwards said his office was notified of the breach in early September then had a full briefing on September 9.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;At the time I was briefed, it appeared that the vulnerability did not compromise detailed patient information such as consultation notes, however I was advised that there was a risk that enrolment records, including identifying information, diagnostic codes and lab results might have been able to be accessed by a third party.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;I was advised that it was not possible to say with certainty whether any of that identifiable data had been accessed and/or exfiltrated.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item></channel></rss>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>MediaWorks, a prominent New Zealand-based broadcasting company&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Impact:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>MediaWorks notified around 403,000 individuals that information they supplied as part of a competition entry had been involved in a cyber attack. The affected database included entries for online competitions dating back to 2016.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The types of information held in this database and accessed by the attacker include name, date of birth, gender, postal address and/or post code, email address, phone number, and in some cases images or videos that may have been submitted as part of the entry.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Importantly, the affected database did not contain passwords, identity documents, financial information, bank accounts or credit card details.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hackers have begun contacting victims directly via email, demanding NZD $820 to prevent their data from being leaked.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Widespread concern among victims and significant reputational damage for MediaWorks.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Summary:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In March 2024, MediaWorks experienced a significant data breach, allegedly carried out by cybercriminals who gained access to the company’s systems and exfiltrated personal data of New Zealanders.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The hackers have contacted individuals affected by the breach, demanding ransom payments in exchange for not leaking their personal information.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Law enforcement agencies are involved in investigating the attack, and MediaWorks has issued guidance to individuals on how to protect themselves.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The hackers&amp;rsquo; demands have escalated concerns over how the data might be used if the ransom is not paid, leading to potential privacy risks for those affected.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>MediaWorks notified the Privacy Commissioner&lt;/li>
&lt;li>MediaWorks reported the incident to * CERT NZ and the New Zealand Police&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In line with New Zealand Government guidance, MediaWorks has not engaged with the attacker.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Summary:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>On 16 March 2023, Latitude1 announced that it had experienced a malicious cyber-attack over the prior few days that resulted in a data theft.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Our investigation identified that the cybercriminals used a compromised credential, obtained via a third-party, to access Latitude&amp;rsquo;s network and steal personal information.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We immediately alerted relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies, including the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) and the Australian Federal Police (AFP), and engaged external cyber security specialists to work alongside our own teams.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This crime remains under investigation by the AFP. We also notified the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) and the New Zealand Office of the Privacy Commissioner (OPC) about the incident on 16 March 2023, and we continue to work with them.&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Ministry of Justice said that the attack was preventing it from accessing 14,500 files relating to the transportation of deceased people’s bodies, and roughly 4,000 post-mortem examinations dating from March 2020 to November.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Te Whatu Ora, the country’s health ministry, said its access to data relating to bereavement and cardiac services was impacted. It said roughly 8,500 records about bereavement care services were inaccessible, alongside 5,500 records from the cardiac and inherited disease registry.
“While the above records are currently inaccessible, there is no evidence at this stage that they have been subject to unauthorized access or download,” said the ministry.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Impact:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The DDoS attacks caused multiple outages, leading to the suspension of trading on the NZX for several days. The exchange experienced interruptions on August 25, 26, and 27, and then again on August 28 and 31. This was a significant disruption as it affected market confidence and the ability of investors to trade.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The trading halts affected not only NZX but also had ripple effects on the broader financial market in New Zealand. Traders and investors were unable to execute orders, which could have led to financial losses, missed opportunities, and overall market uncertainty.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Summary:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A high-level timeline of the incident is as follows:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>a. 10 July 2019 - Tū Ora was directly contacted by the NCSC notifying them that their web server was exposed to a publicly known vulnerability from 2017. This was not actioned by Tū Ora or their IT service provider.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>b. 5 August 2019 - Tū Ora web server was exploited by this method and the attacker ‘defaced’ their website, ultimately alerting Tū Ora that they had been attacked.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>c. 6 August 2019 - Ministry of Health was notified by Tū Ora of the successful attack on their website. Tū Ora Compass Health took immediate steps to contain the incident, called in experts to start an investigation, and notified CERT NZ and the NCSC.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>d. 8 August 2019 - The NCSC initiated a forensic investigation; this is continuing and is expected to take a further two to three weeks.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>e. 15 August 2019 – Tū Ora issued a press release stating that is website had come under attack but did not disclose the likelihood that unencrypted personally identifiable information was also stored on that same server.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>f. 15 August 2019 – NCSC provided an update that three further server exploits were found on the server. Based on the information available to date, the server was compromised twice in 2016, and twice in 2019.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Additionally, access to Tū Ora’s environment would provide access to data held on over one million people that have lived within the geographic area of Capital and Coast, Wairarapa and Mid Central DHBs and registered with a GP over the last 17 years.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Privacy Commissioner John Edwards said his office was notified of the breach in early September then had a full briefing on September 9.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;At the time I was briefed, it appeared that the vulnerability did not compromise detailed patient information such as consultation notes, however I was advised that there was a risk that enrolment records, including identifying information, diagnostic codes and lab results might have been able to be accessed by a third party.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;I was advised that it was not possible to say with certainty whether any of that identifiable data had been accessed and/or exfiltrated.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item></channel></rss>
